CHANGELOG for skore

-- RANT
Somehow, the Github program spazzed out, and so we had to delete the entire repo and re-create.

-- TODO
 - add option to not save game/scores to file

-- 1.2
 - Updated from terminal color codes to ANSIColor
 - Instead of being limited to 3 players, you will now be asked how many players there are
 - Added command "last" which will display the last game you scored, along with the players and their scores.
